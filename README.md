# TSOAX
TSOAX is an open source software to extract and track the growth and
deformation of biopolymer networks from 2D and 3D time-lapse sequences. It
tracks each filament or network branch from complex network dynamics and works
well even if filaments disappear or reappear.

TSOAX is an extension of [SOAX](https://www.lehigh.edu/~div206/soax/) (for
network extraction in static images) to network extraction and tracking in time
lapse movies.

## Installation
### Binaries
You can download and install binaries from [TSOAX
website](https://www.lehigh.edu/~div206/tsoax/).

This website also contains instructions on how to download TSOAX in a docker container

### From source

#### Ubuntu 22.04 (January 2025, for docker image)
1. Install the following libraries with apt-get: 

    build-essential  libeigen3-dev  qtbase5-dev  qtcreator  qt5-qmake
libqt5x11extras5-dev  cmake   x11-apps  cmake-gui
libxt-dev  libboost-all-dev

2. Compile VTK: 
    Start cmake-gui to compile VTK from source (8.2.0, https://github.com/Kitware/VTK/tree/v8.2.0) to a new VTK build directory 

    Chose Unix Makefile; VTK_Group_Qt: yes; BUILD_SHARED_LIBS: no; CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Release

    In VTK build directory: make -j 4

    To fix compiling errors: Add #include \<QPainterPath\> 
    in 
    "VTK-8.2.0\Rendering\Qt\vtkQtLabelRenderStrategy.h" and
    "VTK-8.2.0\Rendering\Qt\vtkQtStringToImage.h"

3. Compile TSOAX: 

    Get TSOAX: $git clone --recursive https://github.com/tix209/TSOAX.git

    cmake-gui to configure from TSOAX from source to a new TSOAX build directory

    Set VTK_DIR to VTK build path

    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release

    Run make in TSOAX build directory. 


#### macOS (February 2022)

3.	Download CMake (GUI version) from cmake.org. This installation was checked with CMake 3.23.0
4.	Download VTK source code. This installation was checked with VTK 8.1.1 from https://github.com/Kitware/VTK/tree/v8.1.1
5.	Configure an Xcode VTK project with CMake. In CMake: 
select Release in CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
activate Module_vtkGUISupportQt, Module_vtk_GUISupportQtOpenGL, VTK_Group_Qt
uncheck BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
set Qt5_DIR to the subfolder clang_64/lib/cmake/Qt5 of the Qt directory
6.	Compile VTK in XCode, selecting Intel and/or Silicon architectures
7.	Download TSOAX git clone --recursive https://github.com/tix209/TSOAX.git
8.	Configure an Xcode TSOAX project with CMake. In CMake:
set Qt5_DIR to the subfolder clang_64/lib/bin of the Qt directory
set VTK_DIR to the build  folder of VTK
9.	Compile a Release version of TSOAX in XCode, selecting Intel and/or Silicon architectures
(You may comment out including omp.h and delete -fopenmp as well update the include directory of eigen3 in the source)


#### Windows
1. Download and install [Microsoft Visual
   Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) 2015 or newer,
   [CMake](https://cmake.org), and [Qt 5](https://www.qt.io). This installation was checked with Qt version up to 5.12. 
2. Configure [VTK](https://www.vtk.org/download/#latest) with CMake (`cmake-gui`). This installation was checked with VTK 8.1.1.
   - Enter the folder path of where you extracted VTK source code
   - Enter another folder path for `vtk_binary_dir`
   - Click `Configure`
   - Specify generator e.g., Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64
   - After the configuration is done, check `VTK_Group_ENABLE_Qt` and `VTK_USE_CXX11_FEATURES`
   - Click `Configure`, and change `VTK_QT_VERSION` to 5 and
     `QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE` to `C:/Qt/5.10/msvc2015_64/bin`
   - Click `Configure`. Set `Qt5_DIR` (e.g. to `C:/Qt/5.12.2/msvc2017_64/lib/cmake5`)
   - Click `Configure`
   - Click `Generate` and then `Open Project`
   - In Visual Studio, change `Debug` to `Release` mode and build solution.
3. Download [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org). Extract the zip file and rename it to `eigen3`.
4. For TSOAX version newer to 0.2.0, install the boost library (used by batch_tsoax) by downloading the Windows binaries. This installation was checked with boost version 1.77.0 
6. Open `Git Bash` then `$ git clone --recursive
   https://github.com/tix209/TSOAX.git`.
5. Configure TSOAX in CMake
   - Enter folder path of TSOAX source code

#### Older compiling instructions for Linux and macOS (>=10.8)
1. Install [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) and [Qt 5](https://www.qt.io)
   using your package manager ([Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or dnf, apt):
   ``` bash
   $ brew install eigen qt@5 cmake # for macOS
   $ sudo dnf install eigen3-devel qt5-devel libXt-devel cmake # for Fedora

   (**macOS only**) Add environment variables in your `.bash_profile`:
   ``` bash
   export Qt5_DIR=/usr/local/opt/qt@5
   export PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt@5/bin:$PATH
   ```
   and apply them: 
   ``` bash
   $ . ~/.bash_profile
   ```
2. Install VTK. Download [VTK](https://www.vtk.org/download/#latest). 
   Do an out-of-source build
   ``` bash
   $ mkdir your-vtk-build-dir
   $ cd your-vtk-build-dir
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVTK_GROUP_ENABLE_Qt=YES -DModule_vtkGUISupportQtOpenGL=ON /path/to/your-VTK-src-dir/
   $ make -j 4
   ```
   Add environment variable `VTK_DIR` in your `.bash_profile`:

   ``` bash
   export VTK_DIR=/path/to/your-vtk-build-dir
   ```
3. Build TSOAX.
   ``` bash
   $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/tix209/TSOAX.git
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release /path/to/tsoax/src/
   $ make -j 4
   ``` 
   In macOS, you can launch the program by searching for "TSOAX" in the
   spotlight (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>).
